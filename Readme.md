# Leetcode Rust
This is a repository for my Leetcode solutions in Rust. I am using this as a way to learn Rust and improve my problem solving skills. I will be adding solutions as I solve them.

# Setup

1. Initialize the template submission file for problem with id {id}
```shell
cargo run

#Output
#Welcome to leetcode-rust system.
#
#Please enter a frontend problem id, 
#or "random" to generate a random one, 
#or "solve $i" to move problem to solution/, 
#or "all" to initialize all problems 

123 # Enter the problem id
```

You can also use `random` or `all` to generate random problems or all problems respectively.


2. Run the tests
```shell
cargo test test_{id}
```

3. Mark the problem as solved
```shell
cargo r

#Output
#Welcome to leetcode-rust system.
#
#Please enter a frontend problem id, 
#or "random" to generate a random one, 
#or "solve $i" to move problem to solution/, 
#or "all" to initialize all problems 

solve 123 # Enter the problem id
```
